    ABSTRACT
    Identification and availability of suitable data sources is a well-known difficulty in music information retrieval re-search. For studies requiring annotated data, this can be compounded by inconsistent presentation formats, differ-ences in methodologies, and annotation errors. By build-ing a framework to apply automated data cleansing and standardization techniques to a collection of MIREX evaluation output data, we were able to extract a large, labelled chord data set for use in a harmonic modelling study. 

IMPORTANT: This repository does not include the MIREX ACE (Automation Chord Estimation) challenge data. The source data can be downloaded from https://github.com/ismir-mirex/ace-output. The entire ace-output-master directory and its contents must be placed within the ./source_data folder of the local chord-data-aggregator instance.
